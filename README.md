Idea for encrypted shared cloud storage - will not take responsibility for anything stored through SplitCloud/misuse of program/data protection

To do

- Log clearing option
- Record clearing option

For server
-
- Using SQL to assign ips display names
- Randomly saving packets onto other user's devices
- Requesting for return of packets
